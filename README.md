# Client Log Data Warehouse #
## A Data Warehouse made using MS SQL Server and a Star Schema Modeling Approach ##

 This Git Repo serves as a reource to recreate this project locally if you choose to do so :) 

⭐️ Disclaimer: Because I am operating on macOS & an Apple Chip, my MS SQL Server is running in a Docker Container ⭐️

### Docker Images Used: ###
MS SQL: https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-azure-sql-edge

### SQL Server Client Used: ###
Azure Data Studio: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/data-studio

 All SQL Queries for the current version of Client Log DW are in their respective folders, and images of the Star Schema ER Diagram as well as sample outputs will be linked in the iImages folder 

**Version One: MVP**
- Basic Star Schema Defined
- Working MS SQL Docker Container 
- Connected MS SQL Server to Azure Data Studio
- Dimension and Fact tables created
- Basic Dummy Data Loaded
- Basic SQL Queries returning proper data (See images for example output)
